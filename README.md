# Port-Container-Management

A console-based Port Container Management System. The system manages containers arriving at the port and ships waiting to be loaded.
- Containers are stored in a stack (LIFO) when unloaded from trucks.
- Ships are lined up in a queue (FIFO) while waiting to be loaded.
- The system allows adding containers and ships, viewing them, and loading the next ship.
